  <conbody>
    <p>When upgrading Conga Orchestrate from a previous version, you must manually rename the Conga Orchestrate Application from ProcessComposer to Conga Orchestrate. A Salesforce limitation prevents the Conga Orchestrate installed packages from automatically updating the application name.</p>
