  <title class="- topic/title ">Orchestrate : Step Field Validations</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>Created by  user-0266f on Mar 11, 2021</p>
    <p>Use Step Field Validations on your steps to prevent the stepâ€™s completion when the configured validation rules return true. Rather than setting up object-specific validation rules in an attempt to control needed data for Conga Orchestrate steps, define validations directly on the Step level inside of Conga Orchestrate and make sure all of the data you expect is there and conditions are met before moving on to the next step in the process.</p>
    <p>Refer to Creating a <xref href="orchestratecreatingaprocessdefinitionvdecember21.dita#t8e25e6" scope="local" format="dita">Definition</xref> and <xref href="orchestrateaboutprocessstepsvsummer21.dita#tf89b4c" scope="local" format="dita">Steps</xref> before creating Step Field Validations.</p>
